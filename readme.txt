you shood install nodogsplash, config it to use the gateaway card you use as the AP
before running be sure your card is at monitor mode(the one used for the attack or defance) 
the screen.py is the GUI, after running it, you choose the network and then the users will be shown
the defance.py is the defance script you shood just run it

in the note i described how to download the nodogsplash, there is also a link to a toturial about how to set it up if my explantion wasnt good
